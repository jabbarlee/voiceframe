              "**Machine Learning (ML)** is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables systems to learn from data and improve their performance without being explicitly programmed for every task. It involves designing and training algorithms that can detect patterns, make decisions, and predict outcomes based on input data. ML has become fundamental in fields like computer vision, natural language processing, bioinformatics, and finance due to its ability to automate complex processes and derive insights from massive datasets.",

Common algorithms include decision trees, support vector machines, and neural networks.\n\n**Unsupervised Learning** deals with unlabeled data, aiming to discover hidden patterns or groupings within the dataset. Clustering (e.g., K-means) and dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA) are typical techniques.\n\n**Reinforcement Learning** trains agents through rewards and penalties to perform tasks in dynamic environments. It's widely used in robotics, game AI, and autonomous systems.",
